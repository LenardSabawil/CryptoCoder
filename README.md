CryptoCoder: A Polyalphabetic Substitution Encryption tool 
 
 
1.	Introduction 
 
      Our crypto-coder is a powerful encryption built with Python and Tkinter framework GUI. 
      An application that utilizes a sophisticated polyalphabetic substitution method to encode messages securely.
      With this CryptoCoder, it can protect your sensitive information or details by replacing characters in your plaintext with carefully 
      chosen characters from multiple alphabets. Hence, our intuitive graphical interface streamlines the encryption processes, 
      allowing it to input text and customize the encryption parameters effortlessly in a user-friendly environment including the 
      functions of encrypting, decrypting, txt.file insertion, can save an encrypted & decrypted file and resetting the text 
      
2.	Features: 
 
      2.1	Method: POLYALPHABETIC SUBSTITUTION 
          - Our cryptocoder utilizes a polyalphabetic substitution method, a cryptographic technique that replaces characters in the plaintext
            with a diverse character from a multiple letter. This approach significantly strengthens the encryption process, making it 
            more resistant to a various decryption attack 

      2.2	Framework: TKINTER GUI 
          - The inclusion of a tkinter-based GUI in CryptoCoder offers a 
            seamless and intuitive interface. Through GUI, users can easily access and input their plaintext, customize encryption 
            parameters, and will visualize the encoded output, facilitating smooth and user-friendly encryption experiences.  

      2.3	Service: DATA PROTECTION:  
           -  With this CryptoCoder, users now can confidently safeguard their sensitive information by leveraging the power 
              of polyalphabetic substitution, this tool ensures that encoded messages are simple but highly resistant to unauthorized access, providing a robust layer of security and with a symmetric algorithm that carries a private key to obfuscate the attackers. 

      2.4	Algorithm: SYMMETRIC ALGORITHM ENCRYPTION 
          - In addition to the polyalphabetic substitution method, this cryptographic incorporates a powerful symmetric algorithm 
            that ensures both encryption and decryption processes utilizing the same key, providing a high level of confidentiality and 
            data integrity.  

3.	How to use Polyalphabetic Substitution CryptoCoder  
 
1	Launch the CryptoCoder application 
          a.	Open the Tkinter GUI. 
          
2	Encryption: 
          a.	Input the plaintext message into the provided text input field. 
          b.	Input the key “1234” to operate the encryption and decryption process  
          c.	Customize encryption parameters, such as the number of alphabets and their arrangement, through the GUI options. 
          d.	Click the “Encrypt” button to initiate the encryption process. 
          e.	The encoded ciphertext will be displayed in the output field. 
          f.	The encrypted ciphertext can save the text file on your desktop, and users may/can decrypt the saved encrypted file message after inserting it in the GUI CryptoCoder which will display the result. 


3	Decryption: 
          a.	Input the encoded ciphertext into the text input field. 
          b.	Ensure that the encryption parameters and symmetric key used during encryption are correctly applied. 
          c.	Click the “Decrypt” button to begin the decryption process. 
          d.	The decrypted plaintext will be displayed in the output field. 
          e.	The decrypted ciphertext can save the text file on your desktop, and users may/can encrypt the saved decrypted file message after inserting it in the GUI CryptoCoder which will display the result. 

4	File Insertion: 
          a.	Locate the “Open File” option in the GUI. 
          b.	Click on the option to select a file from your system. 
          c.	Choose the desired encryption parameters and a symmetric key. iv. Click the “Encrypt” button to encrypt the contents of the file. 
          d.	The encrypted file will be saved in a specified location. 
          e.	Vice versa when saving a decrypted file – this will also save in a specified location.  

5	File Reset: 
          a.	If you desire to clear your text input and output fields, click the “Reset” Button. 
          b.	The input and output fields will be cleared, allowing it to start the process with a fresh message.
